    <h1>Inspirathon</h1>
    <p>"Everybody has a creative potential and from the moment you can express this creative potential, you can start changing the world"
      -Paulo Coelho
      Bring your team and over 48-hours, you'll be tasked with developing a solution for our (currently secretðŸ‘€) topics that will be revealed at the start of the weekend! The hackathon is for students of any level and background to get involved in! Yes we have prizes for our winners, but the aim of the event is to inspire, so get involved and give it a go!!</p>
